# dots-nightly

configuration for neovim nightly build (hence the name).

to install neovim nightly on macOS run:
```sh
$ brew install neovim --HEAD
```

focuses on:
- nvim-lsp integration
- optimized startup time
- brevity of code

**note**: you must install the language servers separately. once you do so, it should integrate with the neovim lsp client.
